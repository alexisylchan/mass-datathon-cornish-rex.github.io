      <p>Have you ever wondered anything about cars and traffic? For the first time <strong>ever</strong>, a state has released information on all of the cars registered in the state. The Massachusetts Vehicle Census combines detailed (but anonymized) data from the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles and vehicle safety inspections as part of the <a href="http://www.37billionmilechallenge.org/">37 Billion Mile Challenge</a>.</p>
      <p>We developed tools and visualizations to explore this data, and hope that you will have as much fun using the data as we had putting the tools together. To go to a specific section in this webpage, click a link below.</p>

        These maps compare the total miles traveled by locally registered vehicles to the total miles traveled. Red areas are highly impacted by region traffic. Not surprisingly, these areas are mainly along the interstate highways. Blue areas have cars with a lot of miles driven, but have relatively little traffic themselves. These areas tend to be outside of Boston and in areas with a lot of commuting. Can you find your city on the map? Is your community highly impacted, or is it affecting others?

        <h3>Making of the Image</h3>
      </div>

      <p>This image of the vehicle miles traveled (VMT) divided by total miles per day in each traffic analysis zone (TAZ) highlights the inequality between places with more vehicle traffic and places where the registered cars drive more miles. Near-highway areas and the Boston metropolitan area pop out as places with exceptionally high traffic volumes and low driving.</p>

      <p>Traffic due to passenger vehicles in each TAZ was obtained from grid_quarters_public (mipdaypass). Each grid was assigned to the TAZ which had the highest spatial overlap. TAZ and VMT layers were obtained through CTPS. The image was produced in QGIS.</p>

      </div>

      <p>How does your driving compare to that of other people in your neighborhood? Did the car use in your zip code change between 2008 and 2011? How does driving in your zip code compare to that in other zip codes in Boston? The Boston Car Data Explorer lets you explore these questions and more. <a href="dc_massdrive3/dc_massdrive_BOSTON.html" target="_new">Click here to start the demo</a></p>

      <p>You will see these graphs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Vehicle mileage (mpg_adj_ave) compared to miles traveled per day: How efficient is your car compared to other cars?</li>
        <li>What kind of vehicle (veh_type) dominates?</li>
        <li>How many hybrid cars are registered?</li>
        <li>What types of fuel are being used?</li>
        <li>How old are most cars?</li>
        <li>Which car makes are most popular?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This was part of an investigation that focused on a popular subset of data -- 21 zip codes within just the Boston municipality. This provided a more manageable dataset with which to visually explore intersections of many filters using multi-dimensional charting. Household income demographic data was incorporated as as a new filter. The resulting highly interactive "Boston Car Data Explorer" web page provides a sense of the variety of interacting factors, and can be extended to explore data for all of Massachusetts at the grid cell to county level. A next step in this effort would be to employ data analytics to identify alternative data sources for filters and measures, along with incorporating additional external data sources.</p>
